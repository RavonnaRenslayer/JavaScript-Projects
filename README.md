# JavaScript Fundamentals â€“ What I've Learned

This document highlights the key concepts and skills I have learned and put into practice during my JavaScript Fundamentals course. Through hands-on exercises and real-world examples, I've developed a strong foundation in JavaScript and its role in web development.

## âœ… Skills and Knowledge Gained

### ðŸ”¹ The Purpose of JavaScript
I learned how JavaScript enhances web pages by making them interactive and dynamic. I now understand its essential role in bringing life to otherwise static HTML and CSS structures.

### ðŸ”¹ JavaScript Syntax
I became familiar with the core syntax of JavaScript, including variables, data types, operators, functions, conditionals, and loops. I have written and debugged multiple scripts using proper JavaScript structure.

### ðŸ”¹ JavaScript with HTML and CSS
I practiced integrating JavaScript with HTML and CSS to create responsive and dynamic user interfaces. I successfully manipulated elements on the page and applied styles programmatically.

### ðŸ”¹ Common Uses of JavaScript
I explored common applications of JavaScript such as form validation, dynamic content updates, modal windows, and image sliders. I implemented these features in my projects.

### ðŸ”¹ The Document Object Model (DOM)
I gained a clear understanding of the DOM and how JavaScript interacts with it. I practiced accessing, modifying, and creating HTML elements dynamically using DOM methods.

### ðŸ”¹ User Interaction
I learned how to handle events like clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard inputs. I built scripts that respond to user interactions in real-time, enhancing user experience.

### ðŸ”¹ Runtime Library
I developed an understanding of JavaScriptâ€™s runtime environment and its reliance on the browser's built-in libraries and APIs. I used these tools to execute code and interact with the web page.

### ðŸ”¹ jQuery Library
I was introduced to jQuery and learned how it simplifies many common JavaScript tasks. I used jQuery to manipulate the DOM, handle events, and create animations with concise syntax.

### ðŸ”¹ When to Use jQuery
I learned to evaluate when jQuery is beneficialâ€”especially for simplifying complex DOM manipulations and ensuring cross-browser compatibility. I also recognized when modern vanilla JavaScript can be a better choice.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Features of jQuery
I practiced using jQueryâ€™s key features including:
- Simplified element selection and manipulation
- Event handling
- Animation effects
- AJAX requests
